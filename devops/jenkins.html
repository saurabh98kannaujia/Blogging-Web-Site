                        streamlining and automating the various stages of software development and delivery.
                    </li>
                    <li>This process involves a series of steps, organized into a pipeline, that are executed during
                        the software product delivery lifecycle. These steps typically include activities such as
                        building the code, conducting tests, and deploying the application.

                <ul style="margin-left: 1rem;">
                    <li>The significance of CI/CD lies in its ability to automate processes, minimizing the

                        of unit tests, code analysis, and security checks. This automation not only expedites the
                        delivery process but also enhances the overall reliability and quality of the software being

                        Jenkins is a Java-based open-source automation platform that serves as an automation server
                        for facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) in software
                        development.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Its core functionality revolves around automating key stages of the development process,
                        including build, test, and deployment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Functioning as a crucial tool for continuous integration, Jenkins is equipped with a variety of
                        plugins tailored to support various aspects of the CI/CD pipeline.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This platform plays a pivotal role in the seamless creation and testing of software projects,
                        providing developers and DevOps engineers with a streamlined approach to integrating changes
                        into projects.

                    <li>
                        Additionally, Jenkins simplifies the process for end-users to access and deploy new builds. Its
                        versatility extends to supporting continuous release practices by integrating with diverse
                        testing and deployment methods.
